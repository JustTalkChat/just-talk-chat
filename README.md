# just-talk-chat

Our application offers a dynamic chat room where users engage in real-time conversations. Leveraging AI, the platform proactively filters and identifies toxic messages, ensuring a positive communication environment. For enhanced moderation, administrators are granted access to a private chatroom, where they can review all flagged toxic content, making our platform both user-friendly and secure.
