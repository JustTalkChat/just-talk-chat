# just-talk-chat

Our application offers a dynamic chat room where users from around the world can engage in real-time conversations. With our built-in translation feature, users can effortlessly communicate across languages, breaking down linguistic barriers and fostering global connections. Leveraging advanced AI, the platform proactively filters and identifies toxic messages, ensuring a positive communication environment. For enhanced moderation, administrators are granted access to a private chatroom, where they can review all flagged toxic content. This unique combination of features makes our platform both user-friendly, secure, and globally accessible.
