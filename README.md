# just-talk-chat

 The "JustTalkChat" platform, hosted on AWS, redefines real-time group chatting by integrating an AI-driven feature that offers reply suggestions to participants. When a message is posted in a group chat, the AI privately asks other users if they'd like pre-written response options. If they agree, these suggestions are sent in a private chat, streamlining the process of replying in the group. This innovation makes JustTalkChat a convenient and interactive solution for both casual and professional communication.
